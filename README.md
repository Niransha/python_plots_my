https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient
I calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient to find out which factors are most related to each other. 
This correlation value ranges between -1 and 1, where -1 indicates that two variables deviate in opposite directions and +1 means two variables deviate in the same direction. 
In this case, we don't have a specific direction, so we can think without the + or - sign. 
The highest correlation value we have is -7.6*10^-17 for the interaction between cutting 3 and hormone_0, which represents the highest correlation.
